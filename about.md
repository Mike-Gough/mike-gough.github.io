# Me talking about myself

*It doesn't happen very often...*

Hello, my name is Mike Gough and I am an Integration Architect based out of Australia. I design and develop integrated software solutions and I use this space to share my work for the benefit of other architects, software developers and technologists.

Having discovered a natural inclination towards analytical thinking and a talent for information technology related fields, I apply my knowledge and skills to get to the core of problems and come up with creative yet logical solutions. I have a great passion for learning and continue to take a quiet yet self determined approach to my endeavours, both professional and personal.

My long term goal is to critically develop the skills I need to manage a team working on a high profile IT project, until then my aspirations include working as a part of a team to design software solutions.
