## Fiction
The below books portray science and technology in a very idealised way and might use a bit of artistic license to keep readers engaged. They can be good to take you back to your roots, give you a new perspective or just for some quick entertainment.

* [What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://store.xkcd.com/pages/if-you-re-looking-for-the-what-if-book): If you've ever wanted answers to questions such as "How much computing power could we could achieve if the entire world population stopped whatever we are doing right now and started doing calculations? How would it compare to a modern-day computer or smartphone?" then this book is for you.

## Non-Fiction
These books are great when it comes to self-learning and improving your own skillset.

* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatternsBook): Otherwise known as the Gang of Four book, this is hands down the best book ever written on object-oriented design and has been very influential in the software development field. This book is a great introduction to software design and architecture for developers.
* [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html): This book by Martin Fowler and Kent Beck acts as a guide to making decisions around when and how to refactor code to keep it cheap and easy to modify to meet future needs.
* [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): I still find it amazing the amount of development teams that I come across who claim to be following an Agile Methodology but who havent read the twelve principles behind the Agile Manifesto. I recommend this short read to anyone working in an agile team, particularly those having dificulties achieving results.
