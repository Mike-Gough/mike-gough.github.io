# About Me

I'm Mike Gough and I am an Integration Architect based out of Australia. I design and develop integrated software solutions and I use this space to share my work for the benefit of other architects, software developers and technologists. Broadly, it covers lessons learned in designing, developing and integrating software.

You can find some of my open source work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mike-Gough).
