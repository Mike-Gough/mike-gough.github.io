The internet is full of how-to guides for architects and software developers, this blog is not one of them. I am *barely* an architect myself, having grasped at an opportunity after a relatively short career as a software developer and I wouldnâ€™t presume to try and teach experts in the field.

I offer by way of explanation, a tale of integrating software. I intend to use this space to document the many projects and prototypes I work on for later reference. I've chosen to make it public so that it might be of some benefit to other architects, software developers and technologists. Along the way I'll share my endeavour to make something useful and lasting whilst being stymied by obstacles both old and new.
